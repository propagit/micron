/**
	The class name "actionBtn" is a reserve class which tells the plugin to initiate the plugin
	
	Alternately Action btn can be manually called without the use of actionBtn, in which case there is no need to define the attributes data-target and data-class, 
	$(selector).action_button(traget button,class_name*);
	eg:
	
	$('.actionBtn').action_button('#myActionBtn','btn-success');
	==> .actionBtn can be any class when called manually.
		#myActionBtn - data-target - if class given it will affect all the buttons with that class
		btn-success - data-class  [note:  there is no dot "." infront of the class name as in the case of data-target]
	
	-- class_name* = name of the class that gets added to the target button - by default btn-success
